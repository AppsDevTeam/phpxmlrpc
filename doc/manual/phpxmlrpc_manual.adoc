[[limitations]]
== Known limitations

This started out as a bare framework. Many "nice" bits have been put in over time, but backwards compatibility has
always taken precedence over API cleanups. As such, you might find some API choices questionable.

Specifically, very little type validation or coercion has been put in. PHP being a loosely-typed language, this is
going to have to be done explicitly (in other words: you can call a lot of library functions passing them arguments
of the wrong type and receive an error message only much further down the code, where it will be difficult to
understand).

dateTime.iso8601 is supported opaquely. Datetime conversion can't be done transparently as the XML-RPC specification
explicitly forbids passing of timezone specifiers in ISO8601 format dates. You can, however, use the PhpXmlRpc\Helper\Date
class to do the encoding and decoding for you.

Very little HTTP response checking is performed (e.g. HTTP redirects are not followed by default and the Content-Length
HTTP header, mandated by the xml-rpc spec, is not validated); cookie support still involves quite a bit of coding on
the part of the user.

Extensions to the XMLRPC protocol, such as the `+<NIL>+` tag, have to be manually enabled before usage.

[[types]]
=== Notes on types

==== int

The type i4 is accepted as a synonym for int when creating xmlrpcval objects. The xml parsing code will always convert i4
to int: int is regarded by this implementation as the canonical name for this type.

The type i8 on the other hand is considered as a separate type. Note that the library will never output integers as 'i8'
on its own, even when php is compiled in 64-bit mode.

==== base64

Base 64 encoding is performed transparently to the caller when using this type. Decoding is also transparent.
Therefore, you ought to consider it as a "binary" data type, for use when you want to pass data that is not 7-bit clean.

==== boolean

The php values `+true+` and `+1+` map to `+true+`. All other values (including the empty string) are converted to
`+false+`.

==== string

Characters <, >;, ', ", &, are encoded using their entity reference as &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot; and
&amp; All other characters outside the ASCII range are encoded using their character reference representation (e.g.
&#200 for Ã©). The XML-RPC spec recommends only encoding ++< >++ but this implementation goes further, for reasons
explained by the http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#syntax[XML 1.0 recommendation]. In particular, using character reference
representation has the advantage of producing XML that is valid independently of the charset encoding assumed.

==== null

There is no support for encoding ++null++ values in the XML-RPC spec, but at least a couple of extensions (and
many toolkits) do support it. Before using ++null++ values in your messages, make sure that the responding party accepts
them, and uses the same encoding convention (see ...).

[[xmlrpc-value]]
=== Value creation

The constructor is the normal way to create an xmlrpcval. The constructor can take these forms:

xmlrpcvalnew
xmlrpcval xmlrpcvalnew
xmlrpcval string $stringVal xmlrpcvalnew
xmlrpcval mixed $scalarVal string$scalartyp xmlrpcvalnew
xmlrpcval array $arrayVal string $arraytyp The first constructor creates an empty value, which must be
    altered using the methods addScalar,
    addArray or addStruct before
    it can be used.

The second constructor creates a simple string value.

The third constructor is used to create a scalar value. The second parameter must be a name of an XML-RPC type. Valid
types are: "++int++", "++boolean++", "++string++", "++double++", "++dateTime.iso8601++", "++base64++" or "null".

Examples:

[source, php]
----
$myInt = new xmlrpcval(1267, "int");
$myString = new xmlrpcval("Hello, World!", "string");
$myBool = new xmlrpcval(1, "boolean");
$myString2 = new xmlrpcval(1.24, "string"); // note: this will serialize a php float value as xmlrpc string
----

The fourth constructor form can be used to compose complex XML-RPC values. The first argument is either a simple array
in the case of an XML-RPC array or an associative array in the case of a struct. The elements of the array __must be
xmlrpcval objects themselves__.

The second parameter must be either "++array++" or "++struct++".

Examples:

[source, php]
----
$myArray = new xmlrpcval(
  array(
    new xmlrpcval("Tom"),
    new xmlrpcval("Dick"),
    new xmlrpcval("Harry")
  ),
  "array");

// recursive struct
$myStruct = new xmlrpcval(
  array(
    "name" => new xmlrpcval("Tom", "string"),
    "age" => new xmlrpcval(34, "int"),
    "address" => new xmlrpcval(
      array(
        "street" => new xmlrpcval("Fifht Ave", "string"),
        "city" => new xmlrpcval("NY", "string")
      ),
      "struct")
  ),
  "struct");
----

See the file ++vardemo.php++ in this distribution for more examples.

[[xmlrpc-client]]
=== Client creation

The constructor accepts one of two possible syntaxes:

xmlrpc_clientnew
xmlrpc_clientstring$server_urlxmlrpc_clientnew
xmlrpc_clientstring$server_pathstring$server_hostnameint$server_port80string$transport'http'

Here are a couple of usage examples of the first form:

[source, php]
----
$client = new xmlrpc_client("http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/server.php");
$another_client = new xmlrpc_client("https://james:bond@secret.service.com:443/xmlrpcserver?agent=007");
----

The second syntax does not allow to express a username and password to be used for basic HTTP authorization as in the
second example above, but instead it allows to choose whether xmlrpc calls will be made using the HTTP 1.0 or 1.1
protocol.

Here's another example client set up to query Userland's XML-RPC server at __betty.userland.com__:

[source, php]
----
$client = new xmlrpc_client("/RPC2", "betty.userland.com", 80);
----

The server_port parameter is optional, and if omitted will default to 80 when using HTTP and 443 when using HTTPS.

The transport parameter is optional, and if omitted will default to 'http'. Allowed values are either 'http', 'https' or
'http11'. Its value can be overridden with every call to the send method. See the send method below for more details
about the meaning of the different values.

[[xmlrpc-server]]
=== Server

The implementation of this class has been kept as simple to use as
possible. The constructor for the server basically does all the work.
Here's a minimal example:

[source, php]
----
  function foo ($xmlrpcmsg) {
    ...
    return new xmlrpcresp($some_xmlrpc_val);
  }

  class bar {
    function foobar($xmlrpcmsg) {
      ...
      return new xmlrpcresp($some_xmlrpc_val);
    }
  }

  $s = new xmlrpc_server(
    array(
      "examples.myFunc1" => array("function" => "foo"),
      "examples.myFunc2" => array("function" => "bar::foobar"),
    ));
----

This performs everything you need to do with a server. The single constructor argument is an associative array
from xmlrpc method names to php function names. The incoming request is parsed and dispatched to the relevant php
function, which is responsible for returning a xmlrpcresp object, that will be serialized back to the caller.

==== Method handler functions

Both php functions and class methods can be registered as xmlrpc method handlers.

The synopsis of a method handler function is:

xmlrpcresp $resp = function (xmlrpcmsg $msg)

No text should be echoed 'to screen' by the handler function, or it will break the xml response sent back to the client.
This applies also to error and warning messages that PHP prints to screen unless the appropriate parameters have been
set in the php.in file. Another way to prevent echoing of errors inside the response and facilitate debugging is to use
the server SetDebug method with debug level 3 (see ...). Exceptions thrown during execution of handler functions are
caught by default and a XML-RPC error response is generated instead. This behaviour can be fine-tuned by usage of the
exception_handling member variable (see ...).

Note that if you implement a method with a name prefixed by ++system.++ the handler function will be invoked by the
server with two parameters, the first being the server itself and the second being the xmlrpcmsg object.

The same php function can be registered as handler of multiple xmlrpc methods.

Here is a more detailed example of what the handler function foo may do:

[source, php]
----
  function foo ($xmlrpcmsg) {
    global $xmlrpcerruser; // import user errcode base value

    $meth = $xmlrpcmsg->method(); // retrieve method name
    $par = $xmlrpcmsg->getParam(0); // retrieve value of first parameter - assumes at least one param received
    $val = $par->scalarval(); // decode value of first parameter - assumes it is a scalar value

    ...

    if ($err) {
      // this is an error condition
      return new xmlrpcresp(0, $xmlrpcerruser+1, // user error 1
        "There's a problem, Captain");
    } else {
      // this is a successful value being returned
      return new xmlrpcresp(new xmlrpcval("All's fine!", "string"));
    }
  }
----

See __server.php__ in this distribution for more examples of how to do this.

Since release 2.0RC3 there is a new, even simpler way of registering php functions with the server. See section ...
below

==== The dispatch map

The first argument to the xmlrpc_server constructor is an array, called the __dispatch map__.
In this array is the information the server needs to service the XML-RPC methods you define.

The dispatch map takes the form of an associative array of associative arrays: the outer array has one entry for each
method, the key being the method name. The corresponding value is another associative array, which can have the following
members:

* ++function++ - this
  entry is mandatory. It must be either a name of a function in the
  global scope which services the XML-RPC method, or an array
  containing an instance of an object and a static method name (for
  static class methods the 'class::method' syntax is also
  supported).

* ++signature++ - this
  entry is an array containing the possible signatures (see <<signatures>>) for the method. If this entry is present
  then the server will check that the correct number and type of
  parameters have been sent for this method before dispatching
  it.

* ++docstring++ - this
  entry is a string containing documentation for the method. The
  documentation may contain HTML markup.

* ++$$signature_docs$$++ - this entry can be used
  to provide documentation for the single parameters. It must match
  in structure the 'signature' member. By default, only the
  documenting_xmlrpc_server class in the
  extras package will take advantage of this, since the
  "system.methodHelp" protocol does not support documenting method
  parameters individually.


* ++$$parameters_type$$++ - this entry can be used
  when the server is working in 'xmlrpcvals' mode (see ...) to
  define one or more entries in the dispatch map as being functions
  that follow the 'phpvals' calling convention. The only useful
  value is currently the string ++phpvals++.

Look at the __server.php__ example in the distribution to see what a dispatch map looks like.

[[signatures]]
==== Method signatures

A signature is a description of a method's return type and its parameter types. A method may have more than one
signature.

Within a server's dispatch map, each method has an array of possible signatures. Each signature is an array of types.
The first entry is the return type. For instance, the method

[source, php]
----
string examples.getStateName(int)
----

 has the signature

[source, php]
----
array($xmlrpcString, $xmlrpcInt)
----

and, assuming that it is the only possible signature for the method, it might be used like this in server creation:

[source, php]
----
$findstate_sig = array(array($xmlrpcString, $xmlrpcInt));

$findstate_doc = 'When passed an integer between 1 and 51 returns the
name of a US state, where the integer is the index of that state name
in an alphabetic order.';

$s = new xmlrpc_server( array(
  "examples.getStateName" => array(
    "function" => "findstate",
    "signature" => $findstate_sig,
    "docstring" => $findstate_doc
  )));
----

Note that method signatures do not allow to check nested parameters, e.g. the number, names and types of the members of
a struct param cannot be validated.

If a method that you want to expose has a definite number of parameters, but each of those parameters could reasonably
be of multiple types, the array of acceptable signatures will easily grow into a combinatorial explosion. To avoid such
a situation, the lib defines the global var $xmlrpcValue, which can be used in method signatures as a placeholder for
'any xmlrpc type':

[source, php]
----
$echoback_sig = array(array($xmlrpcValue, $xmlrpcValue));

$findstate_doc = 'Echoes back to the client the received value, regardless of its type';

$s = new xmlrpc_server( array(
  "echoBack" => array(
    "function" => "echoback",
    "signature" => $echoback_sig, // this sig guarantees that the method handler will be called with one and only one parameter
    "docstring" => $echoback_doc
  )));
----

Methods system.listMethods,
system.methodHelp,
system.methodSignature and
system.multicall are already defined by the
server, and should not be reimplemented (see Reserved Methods
below).

==== Delaying the server response

You may want to construct the server, but for some reason not fulfill the request immediately (security verification,
for instance). If you omit to pass to the constructor the dispatch map or pass it a second argument of ++0++ this will
have the desired effect. You can then use the service() method of the server class to service the request. For example:

[source, php]
----
$s = new xmlrpc_server($myDispMap, 0); // second parameter = 0 prevents automatic servicing of request

// ... some code that does other stuff here

$s->service();
----

Note that the service method will print the complete result payload to screen and send appropriate HTTP headers back to
the client, but also return the response object. This permits further manipulation of the response, possibly in
combination with output buffering.

To prevent the server from sending HTTP headers back to the client, you can pass a second parameter with a value of
++TRUE++ to the service method. In this case, the response payload will be returned instead of the response object.

Xmlrpc requests retrieved by other means than HTTP POST bodies can also be processed. For example:

[source, php]
----
$s = new xmlrpc_server(); // not passing a dispatch map prevents automatic servicing of request

// ... some code that does other stuff here, including setting dispatch map into server object

$resp = $s->service($xmlrpc_request_body, true); // parse a variable instead of POST body, retrieve response payload

// ... some code that does other stuff with xml response $resp here
----

==== Modifying the server behaviour

A couple of methods / class variables are available to modify the behaviour of the server. The only way to take
advantage of their existence is by usage of a delayed server response (see above).

===== setDebug()

This function controls weather the server is going to echo debugging messages back to the client as comments in response
body. Valid values: 0,1,2,3, with 1 being the default. At level 0, no debug info is returned to the client. At level 2,
the complete client request is added to the response, as part of the xml
comments. At level 3, a new PHP error handler is set when executing user functions exposed as server methods, and all
non-fatal errors are trapped and added as comments into the response.

===== allow_system_funcs

Default_value: TRUE. When set to FALSE, disables support for System.xxx functions in the server. It might be useful e.g.
if you do not wish the server to respond to requests to System.ListMethods.

===== compress_response

When set to TRUE, enables the server to take advantage of HTTP compression, otherwise disables it. Responses will be
transparently compressed, but only when an xmlrpc-client declares its support for compression in the HTTP headers of the
request.

Note that the ZLIB php extension must be installed for this to work. If it is, compress_response will default to TRUE.

===== exception_handling

This variable controls the behaviour of the server when an exception is thrown by a method handler php function. Valid
values: 0,1,2, with 0 being the default. At level 0, the server catches the exception and return an 'internal error'
xmlrpc response; at 1 it catches the exceptions and return an xmlrpc response with the error code and error message
corresponding to the exception that was thrown; at 2 = the exception is floated to the upper layers in the code.

===== response_charset_encoding

Charset encoding to be used for response (only affects string values).

If it can, the server will convert the generated response from internal_encoding to the intended one.

Valid values are: a supported xml encoding (only UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 at present, unless mbstring is enabled), null
(leave charset unspecified in response and convert output stream to US_ASCII), 'default' (use xmlrpc library default as
specified in xmlrpc.inc, convert output stream if needed), or 'auto' (use client-specified charset encoding or same as
request if request headers do not specify it (unless request is US-ASCII: then use library default anyway).

==== Fault reporting

Fault codes for your servers should start at the value indicated by the global ++$xmlrpcerruser++ + 1.

Standard errors returned by the server include:

++1++ Unknown method:: Returned if the server was asked to dispatch a method it
    didn't know about

++2++ Invalid return payload:: This error is actually generated by the client, not
    server, code, but signifies that a server returned something it
    couldn't understand. A more detailed error report is sometimes
    added onto the end of the phrase above.

++3++ Incorrect parameters:: This error is generated when the server has signature(s)
    defined for a method, and the parameters passed by the client do
    not match any of signatures.

++4++ Can't introspect: method unknown:: This error is generated by the builtin
    system.* methods when any kind of
    introspection is attempted on a method undefined by the
    server.

++5++ Didn't receive 200 OK from remote server:: This error is generated by the client when a remote server
    doesn't return HTTP/1.1 200 OK in response to a request. A more
    detailed error report is added onto the end of the phrase
    above.

++6++ No data received from server:: This error is generated by the client when a remote server
    returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK in response to a request, but no
    response body follows the HTTP headers.

++7++ No SSL support compiled in:: This error is generated by the client when trying to send
    a request with HTTPS and the CURL extension is not available to
    PHP.

++8++ CURL error:: This error is generated by the client when trying to send
    a request with HTTPS and the HTTPS communication fails.

++9-14++ multicall errors:: These errors are generated by the server when something
    fails inside a system.multicall request.

++100-++ XML parse errors:: Returns 100 plus the XML parser error code for the fault
    that occurred. The faultString returned
    explains where the parse error was in the incoming XML
    stream.

==== 'New style' servers

In the same spirit of simplification that inspired the xmlrpc_client::return_type class variable, a new class variable
has been added to the server class: functions_parameters_type. When set to 'phpvals', the functions registered in the
server dispatch map will be called with plain php values as parameters, instead of a single xmlrpcmsg instance parameter.
The return value of those functions is expected to be a plain php value, too. An example is worth a thousand words:

[source, php]
----
  function foo($usr_id, $out_lang='en') {
    global $xmlrpcerruser;

    ...

    if ($someErrorCondition)
      return new xmlrpcresp(0, $xmlrpcerruser+1, 'DOH!');
    else
      return array(
        'name' => 'Joe',
        'age' => 27,
        'picture' => new xmlrpcval(file_get_contents($picOfTheGuy), 'base64')
      );
  }

  $s = new xmlrpc_server(
    array(
      "examples.myFunc" => array(
        "function" => "bar::foobar",
        "signature" => array(
          array($xmlrpcString, $xmlrpcInt),
          array($xmlrpcString, $xmlrpcInt, $xmlrpcString)
        )
      )
    ), false);
  $s->functions_parameters_type = 'phpvals';
  $s->service();
----

There are a few things to keep in mind when using this simplified syntax:

to return an xmlrpc error, the method handler function must return an instance of xmlrpcresp. The only
other way for the server to know when an error response should be served to the client is to throw an exception and set
the server's exception_handling member var to 1;

to return a base64 value, the method handler function must encode it on its own, creating an instance of an xmlrpcval
object;

the method handler function cannot determine the name of the xmlrpc method it is serving, unlike standard handler
functions that can retrieve it from the message object;

when receiving nested parameters, the method handler function has no way to distinguish a php string that was sent as
base64 value from one that was sent as a string value;

this has a direct consequence on the support of system.multicall: a method whose signature contains datetime or base64
values will not be available to multicall calls;

last but not least, the direct parsing of xml to php values is much faster than using xmlrpcvals, and allows the library
to handle much bigger messages without allocating all available server memory or smashing PHP recursive call stack.

[[reserved]]
=== Reserved methods

In order to extend the functionality offered by XML-RPC servers without impacting on the protocol, reserved methods are
supported.

All methods starting with system. are considered reserved by the server. PHP for XML-RPC itself provides four
special methods, detailed in this chapter.

Note that all server objects will automatically respond to clients querying these methods, unless the property
allow_system_funcs has been set to false before calling the service() method. This might pose a security risk
if the server is exposed to public access, e.g. on the internet.

==== system.getCapabilities

==== system.listMethods

This method may be used to enumerate the methods implemented by the XML-RPC server.

The system.listMethods method requires no parameters. It returns an array of strings, each of which is the name of
a method implemented by the server.

[[sysmethodsig]]
==== system.methodSignature

This method takes one parameter, the name of a method implemented by the XML-RPC server.

It returns an array of possible signatures for this method. A signature is an array of types. The first of these types
is the return type of the method, the rest are parameters.

Multiple signatures (i.e. overloading) are permitted: this is the reason that an array of signatures are returned by this
method.

Signatures themselves are restricted to the top level parameters expected by a method. For instance if a method expects
one array of structs as a parameter, and it returns a string, its signature is simply
"string, array". If it expects three integers, its signature is "string, int, int, int".

For parameters that can be of more than one type, the "undefined" string is supported.

If no signature is defined for the method, a not-array value is returned. Therefore, this is the way to test for a
non-signature, if $resp below is the response object from a method call to system.methodSignature:

[source, php]
----
$v = $resp->value();
if ($v->kindOf() != "array") {
  // then the method did not have a signature defined
}
----

See the __introspect.php__ demo included in this distribution for an example of using this method.

[[sysmethhelp]]
==== system.methodHelp

This method takes one parameter, the name of a method implemented by the XML-RPC server.

It returns a documentation string describing the use of that method. If no such string is available, an empty string is
returned.

The documentation string may contain HTML markup.

==== system.multicall

This method takes one parameter, an array of 'request' struct types. Each request struct must contain a methodName
member of type string and a params member of type array, and corresponds to the invocation of the corresponding method.

It returns a response of type array, with each value of the array being either an error struct (containing the faultCode
and faultString members) or the successful response value of the corresponding single method call.

[[globalvars]]
=== Global variables

Many global variables are defined in the xmlrpc.inc file. Some of
those are meant to be used as constants (and modifying their value might
cause unpredictable behaviour), while some others can be modified in your
php scripts to alter the behaviour of the xml-rpc client and
server.

==== "Constant" variables

===== $xmlrpcerruser

$xmlrpcerruser800The minimum value for errors reported by user
implemented XML-RPC servers. Error numbers lower than that are
reserved for library usage.

===== $xmlrpcI4, $xmlrpcI8 $xmlrpcInt, $xmlrpcBoolean, $xmlrpcDouble, $xmlrpcString, $xmlrpcDateTime, $xmlrpcBase64, $xmlrpcArray, $xmlrpcStruct, $xmlrpcValue, $xmlrpcNull

For convenience the strings representing the XML-RPC types have been encoded as global variables:
[source, php]
----
$xmlrpcI4="i4";
$xmlrpcI8="i8";
$xmlrpcInt="int";
$xmlrpcBoolean="boolean";
$xmlrpcDouble="double";
$xmlrpcString="string";
$xmlrpcDateTime="dateTime.iso8601";
$xmlrpcBase64="base64";
$xmlrpcArray="array";
$xmlrpcStruct="struct";
$xmlrpcValue="undefined";
$xmlrpcNull="null";
----

===== $xmlrpcTypes, $xmlrpc_valid_parents, $xmlrpcerr, $xmlrpcstr, $xmlrpcerrxml, $xmlrpc_backslash, $_xh, $xml_iso88591_Entities, $xmlEntities, $xmlrpcs_capabilities

Reserved for internal usage.

==== Variables whose value can be modified

[[xmlrpc-defencoding]]
===== xmlrpc_defencoding

$xmlrpc_defencoding"UTF8"This variable defines the character set encoding that will be
used by the xml-rpc client and server to decode the received messages,
when a specific charset declaration is not found (in the messages sent
non-ascii chars are always encoded using character references, so that
the produced xml is valid regardless of the charset encoding
assumed).

Allowed values: ++"UTF8"++, ++"ISO-8859-1"++, ++"ASCII".++

Note that the appropriate RFC actually mandates that XML
received over HTTP without indication of charset encoding be treated
as US-ASCII, but many servers and clients 'in the wild' violate the
standard, and assume the default encoding is UTF-8.

===== xmlrpc_internalencoding

$xmlrpc_internalencoding"ISO-8859-1"This variable defines the character set encoding
that the library uses to transparently encode into valid XML the
xml-rpc values created by the user and to re-encode the received
xml-rpc values when it passes them to the PHP application. It only
affects xml-rpc values of string type. It is a separate value from
xmlrpc_defencoding, allowing e.g. to send/receive xml messages encoded
on-the-wire in US-ASCII and process them as UTF-8. It defaults to the
character set used internally by PHP (unless you are running an
MBString-enabled installation), so you should change it only in
special situations, if e.g. the string values exchanged in the xml-rpc
messages are directly inserted into / fetched from a database
configured to return UTF8 encoded strings to PHP. Example
usage:

[source, php]
----
<?php

include('xmlrpc.inc');
$xmlrpc_internalencoding = 'UTF-8'; // this has to be set after the inclusion above
$v = new xmlrpcval('ÃÂºÃ¡Â½Â¹ÃÂÃÂ¼ÃÂµ'); // This xmlrpc value will be correctly serialized as the greek word 'kosme'
----

===== xmlrpcName

$xmlrpcName"XML-RPC for PHP"The string representation of the name of the XML-RPC
for PHP library. It is used by the client for building the User-Agent
HTTP header that is sent with every request to the server. You can
change its value if you need to customize the User-Agent
string.

===== xmlrpcVersion

$xmlrpcVersion"2.2"The string representation of the version number of
the XML-RPC for PHP library in use. It is used by the client for
building the User-Agent HTTP header that is sent with every request to
the server. You can change its value if you need to customize the
User-Agent string.

===== xmlrpc_null_extension

When set to TRUE, the lib will enable
support for the <NIL/> (and <EX:NIL/>) xmlrpc value, as
per the extension to the standard proposed here. This means that
<NIL> and <EX:NIL/> tags received will be parsed as valid
xmlrpc, and the corresponding xmlrpcvals will return "null" for
scalarTyp().

===== xmlrpc_null_apache_encoding

When set to ++TRUE++, php NULL values encoded
into xmlrpcval objects get serialized using the
++<EX:NIL/>++ tag instead of
++<NIL/>++. Please note that both forms are
always accepted as input regardless of the value of this
variable.

[[helpers]]
=== Helper functions

XML-RPC for PHP contains some helper functions which you can use to
make processing of XML-RPC requests easier.

==== Date functions

The XML-RPC specification has this to say on dates:

[quote]
____
[[wrap_xmlrpc_method]]
Don't assume a timezone. It should be
specified by the server in its documentation what assumptions it makes
about timezones.
____

Unfortunately, this means that date processing isn't
straightforward. Although XML-RPC uses ISO 8601 format dates, it doesn't
use the timezone specifier.

We strongly recommend that in every case where you pass dates in
XML-RPC calls, you use UTC (GMT) as your timezone. Most computer
languages include routines for handling GMT times natively, and you
won't have to translate between timezones.

For more information about dates, see link:$$http://www.uic.edu/year2000/datefmt.html$$[ISO 8601: The Right Format for Dates], which has a handy link to a PDF of the ISO
8601 specification. Note that XML-RPC uses exactly one of the available
representations: CCYYMMDDTHH:MM:SS.

[[iso8601encode]]
===== iso8601_encode

stringiso8601_encodestring$time_tint$utc0Returns an ISO 8601 formatted date generated from the UNIX
timestamp $time_t, as returned by the PHP
function time().

The argument $utc can be omitted, in
which case it defaults to ++0++. If it is set to
++1++, then the function corrects the time passed in
for UTC. Example: if you're in the GMT-6:00 timezone and set
$utc, you will receive a date representation
six hours ahead of your local time.

The included demo program __vardemo.php__
includes a demonstration of this function.

[[iso8601decode]]
===== iso8601_decode

intiso8601_decodestring$isoStringint$utc0Returns a UNIX timestamp from an ISO 8601 encoded time and date
string passed in. If $utc is
++1++ then $isoString is assumed
to be in the UTC timezone, and thus the result is also UTC: otherwise,
the timezone is assumed to be your local timezone and you receive a
local timestamp.

[[arrayuse]]
==== Easy use with nested PHP values

Dan Libby was kind enough to contribute two helper functions that
make it easier to translate to and from PHP values. This makes it easier
to deal with complex structures. At the moment support is limited to
int, double, string,
array, datetime and struct
datatypes; note also that all PHP arrays are encoded as structs, except
arrays whose keys are integer numbers starting with 0 and incremented by
1.

These functions reside in __xmlrpc.inc__.

[[phpxmlrpcdecode]]
===== php_xmlrpc_decode

mixedphp_xmlrpc_decodexmlrpcval$xmlrpc_valarray$optionsarrayphp_xmlrpc_decodexmlrpcmsg$xmlrpcmsg_valstring$optionsReturns a native PHP value corresponding to the values found in
the xmlrpcval $xmlrpc_val,
translated into PHP types. Base-64 and datetime values are
automatically decoded to strings.

In the second form, returns an array containing the parameters
of the given
xmlrpcmsg_val, decoded
to php types.

The options parameter is optional. If
specified, it must consist of an array of options to be enabled in the
decoding process. At the moment the only valid option are
decode_php_objs and
++$$dates_as_objects$$++. When the first is set, php
objects that have been converted to xml-rpc structs using the
php_xmlrpc_encode function and a corresponding
encoding option will be converted back into object values instead of
arrays (provided that the class definition is available at
reconstruction time). When the second is set, XML-RPC datetime values
will be converted into native dateTime objects
instead of strings.

____WARNING__:__ please take
extreme care before enabling the decode_php_objs
option: when php objects are rebuilt from the received xml, their
constructor function will be silently invoked. This means that you are
allowing the remote end to trigger execution of uncontrolled PHP code
on your server, opening the door to code injection exploits. Only
enable this option when you have complete trust of the remote
server/client.

Example:
[source, php]
----
// wrapper to expose an existing php function as xmlrpc method handler
function foo_wrapper($m)
{
  $params = php_xmlrpc_decode($m);
  $retval = call_user_func_array('foo', $params);
  return new xmlrpcresp(new xmlrpcval($retval)); // foo return value will be serialized as string
}

$s = new xmlrpc_server(array(
   "examples.myFunc1" => array(
     "function" => "foo_wrapper",
     "signatures" => ...
  )));
----

[[phpxmlrpcencode]]
===== php_xmlrpc_encode

xmlrpcvalphp_xmlrpc_encodemixed$phpvalarray$optionsReturns an xmlrpcval object populated with the PHP
values in $phpval. Works recursively on arrays
and objects, encoding numerically indexed php arrays into array-type
xmlrpcval objects and non numerically indexed php arrays into
struct-type xmlrpcval objects. Php objects are encoded into
struct-type xmlrpcvals, excepted for php values that are already
instances of the xmlrpcval class or descendants thereof, which will
not be further encoded. Note that there's no support for encoding php
values into base-64 values. Encoding of date-times is optionally
carried on on php strings with the correct format.

The options parameter is optional. If
specified, it must consist of an array of options to be enabled in the
encoding process. At the moment the only valid options are
encode_php_objs, ++$$null_extension$$++
and auto_dates.

The first will enable the creation of 'particular' xmlrpcval
objects out of php objects, that add a "php_class" xml attribute to
their serialized representation. This attribute allows the function
php_xmlrpc_decode to rebuild the native php objects (provided that the
same class definition exists on both sides of the communication). The
second allows to encode php ++NULL++ values to the
++<NIL/>++ (or
++<EX:NIL>++, see ...) tag. The last encodes any
string that matches the ISO8601 format into an XML-RPC
datetime.

Example:
[source, php]
----
// the easy way to build a complex xml-rpc struct, showing nested base64 value and datetime values
$val = php_xmlrpc_encode(array(
  'first struct_element: an int' => 666,
  'second: an array' => array ('apple', 'orange', 'banana'),
  'third: a base64 element' => new xmlrpcval('hello world', 'base64'),
  'fourth: a datetime' => '20060107T01:53:00'
  ), array('auto_dates'));
----

===== php_xmlrpc_decode_xml

xmlrpcval | xmlrpcresp |
  xmlrpcmsgphp_xmlrpc_decode_xmlstring$xmlarray$optionsDecodes the xml representation of either an xmlrpc request,
    response or single value, returning the corresponding php-xmlrpc
    object, or ++FALSE++ in case of an error.

The options parameter is optional. If
specified, it must consist of an array of options to be enabled in the
decoding process. At the moment, no option is supported.

Example:
[source, php]
----
$text = '<value><array><data><value>Hello world</value></data></array></value>';
$val = php_xmlrpc_decode_xml($text);
if ($val) echo 'Found a value of type '.$val->kindOf(); else echo 'Found invalid xml';
----

==== Automatic conversion of php functions into xmlrpc methods (and vice versa)

For the extremely lazy coder, helper functions have been added
that allow to convert a php function into an xmlrpc method, and a
remotely exposed xmlrpc method into a local php function - or a set of
methods into a php class. Note that these comes with many caveat.

===== wrap_xmlrpc_method

stringwrap_xmlrpc_method$client$methodname$extra_optionsstringwrap_xmlrpc_method$client$methodname$signum$timeout$protocol$funcnameGiven an xmlrpc server and a method name, creates a php wrapper
function that will call the remote method and return results using
native php types for both params and results. The generated php
function will return an xmlrpcresp object for failed xmlrpc
calls.

The second syntax is deprecated, and is listed here only for
backward compatibility.

The server must support the
system.methodSignature xmlrpc method call for
this function to work.

The client param must be a valid
xmlrpc_client object, previously created with the address of the
target xmlrpc server, and to which the preferred communication options
have been set.

The optional parameters can be passed as array key,value pairs
in the extra_options param.

The signum optional param has the purpose
of indicating which method signature to use, if the given server
method has multiple signatures (defaults to 0).

The timeout and
protocol optional params are the same as in the
xmlrpc_client::send() method.

If set, the optional new_function_name
parameter indicates which name should be used for the generated
function. In case it is not set the function name will be
auto-generated.

If the ++$$return_source$$++ optional parameter is
set, the function will return the php source code to build the wrapper
function, instead of evaluating it (useful to save the code and use it
later as stand-alone xmlrpc client).

If the ++$$encode_php_objs$$++ optional parameter is
set, instances of php objects later passed as parameters to the newly
created function will receive a 'special' treatment that allows the
server to rebuild them as php objects instead of simple arrays. Note
that this entails using a "slightly augmented" version of the xmlrpc
protocol (ie. using element attributes), which might not be understood
by xmlrpc servers implemented using other libraries.

If the ++$$decode_php_objs$$++ optional parameter is
set, instances of php objects that have been appropriately encoded by
the server using a coordinate option will be deserialized as php
objects instead of simple arrays (the same class definition should be
present server side and client side).

__Note that this might pose a security risk__,
since in order to rebuild the object instances their constructor
method has to be invoked, and this means that the remote server can
trigger execution of unforeseen php code on the client: not really a
code injection, but almost. Please enable this option only when you
trust the remote server.

In case of an error during generation of the wrapper function,
FALSE is returned, otherwise the name (or source code) of the new
function.

Known limitations: server must support
system.methodsignature for the wanted xmlrpc
method; for methods that expose multiple signatures, only one can be
picked; for remote calls with nested xmlrpc params, the caller of the
generated php function has to encode on its own the params passed to
the php function if these are structs or arrays whose (sub)members
include values of type base64.

Note: calling the generated php function 'might' be slow: a new
xmlrpc client is created on every invocation and an xmlrpc-connection
opened+closed. An extra 'debug' param is appended to the parameter
list of the generated php function, useful for debugging
purposes.

Example usage:

[source, php]
----
$c = new xmlrpc_client('http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/server.php');

$function = wrap_xmlrpc_method($client, 'examples.getStateName');

if (!$function)
  die('Cannot introspect remote method');
else {
  $stateno = 15;
  $statename = $function($a);
  if (is_a($statename, 'xmlrpcresp')) // call failed
  {
    echo 'Call failed: '.$statename->faultCode().'. Calling again with debug on';
    $function($a, true);
  }
  else
    echo "OK, state nr. $stateno is $statename";
}
----

[[wrap_php_function]]
===== wrap_php_function

arraywrap_php_functionstring$funcnamestring$wrapper_function_namearray$extra_optionsGiven a user-defined PHP function,
create a PHP 'wrapper'
function that can be exposed as xmlrpc method from an xmlrpc_server
object and called from remote clients, and return the appropriate
definition to be added to a server's dispatch map.

The optional $wrapper_function_name
specifies the name that will be used for the auto-generated
function.

Since php is a typeless language, to infer types of input and
output parameters, it relies on parsing the javadoc-style comment
block associated with the given function. Usage of xmlrpc native types
(such as datetime.dateTime.iso8601 and base64) in the docblock @param
tag is also allowed, if you need the php function to receive/send data
in that particular format (note that base64 encoding/decoding is
transparently carried out by the lib, while datetime vals are passed
around as strings).

Known limitations: only works for
user-defined functions, not for PHP internal functions (reflection
does not support retrieving number/type of params for those); the
wrapped php function will not be able to programmatically return an
xmlrpc error response.

If the ++$$return_source$$++ optional parameter is
set, the function will return the php source code to build the wrapper
function, instead of evaluating it (useful to save the code and use it
later in a stand-alone xmlrpc server). It will be in the stored in the
++source++ member of the returned array.

If the ++$$suppress_warnings$$++ optional parameter
is set, any runtime warning generated while processing the
user-defined php function will be caught and not be printed in the
generated xml response.

If the extra_options array contains the
++$$encode_php_objs$$++ value, wrapped functions returning
php objects will generate "special" xmlrpc responses: when the xmlrpc
decoding of those responses is carried out by this same lib, using the
appropriate param in php_xmlrpc_decode(), the objects will be
rebuilt.

In short: php objects can be serialized, too (except for their
resource members), using this function. Other libs might choke on the
very same xml that will be generated in this case (i.e. it has a
nonstandard attribute on struct element tags)

If the ++$$decode_php_objs$$++ optional parameter is
set, instances of php objects that have been appropriately encoded by
the client using a coordinate option will be deserialized and passed
to the user function as php objects instead of simple arrays (the same
class definition should be present server side and client
side).

__Note that this might pose a security risk__,
since in order to rebuild the object instances their constructor
method has to be invoked, and this means that the remote client can
trigger execution of unforeseen php code on the server: not really a
code injection, but almost. Please enable this option only when you
trust the remote clients.

Example usage:

[source, php]
----
/**
* State name from state number decoder. NB: do NOT remove this comment block.
* @param integer $stateno the state number
* @return string the name of the state (or error description)
*/
function findstate($stateno)
{
  global $stateNames;
  if (isset($stateNames[$stateno-1]))
  {
    return $stateNames[$stateno-1];
  }
  else
  {
    return "I don't have a state for the index '" . $stateno . "'";
  }
}

// wrap php function, build xmlrpc server
$methods = array();
$findstate_sig = wrap_php_function('findstate');
if ($findstate_sig)
  $methods['examples.getStateName'] = $findstate_sig;
$srv = new xmlrpc_server($methods);

[[debugging]]
=== Debugging aids

==== xmlrpc_debugmsg

void xmlrpc_debugmsgstring$debugstringSends the contents of $debugstring in XML
comments in the server return payload. If a PHP client has debugging
turned on, the user will be able to see server debug
information.

Use this function in your methods so you can pass back
diagnostic information. It is only available from
__xmlrpcs.inc__.

=== Removed from the library

The following two functions have been deprecated in version 1.1 of
the library, and removed in version 2, in order to avoid conflicts with
the EPI xml-rpc library, which also defines two functions with the same

To ease the transition to the new naming scheme and avoid breaking
existing implementations, the following scheme has been adopted:

* If EPI-XMLRPC is not active in the current PHP installation,
the constant `+XMLRPC_EPI_ENABLED+` will be set to '0'


* If EPI-XMLRPC is active in the current PHP installation, the
constant `+XMLRPC_EPI_ENABLED+` will be set to '1'

[[qanda]]
== Frequently Asked Questions

=== How to send custom XML as payload of a method call

Unfortunately, at the time the XML-RPC spec was designed, support
for namespaces in XML was not as ubiquitous as it is now. As a
consequence, no support was provided in the protocol for embedding XML
elements from other namespaces into an xmlrpc request.

To send an XML "chunk" as payload of a method call or response,
two options are available: either send the complete XML block as a
string xmlrpc value, or as a base64 value. Since the '<' character in
string values is encoded as '&lt;' in the xml payload of the method
call, the XML string will not break the surrounding xmlrpc, unless
characters outside the assumed character set are used. The second
method has the added benefits of working independently of the charset
encoding used for the xml to be transmitted, and preserving exactly
whitespace, whilst incurring in some extra message length and cpu load
(for carrying out the base64 encoding/decoding).

=== Is there any limitation on the size of the requests / responses that can be successfully sent?

Yes. But I have no hard figure to give; it most likely will depend
on the version of PHP in usage and its configuration.

Keep in mind that this library is not optimized for speed nor for
memory usage. Better alternatives exist when there are strict
requirements on throughput or resource usage, such as the php native
xmlrpc extension (see the PHP manual for more information).

Keep in mind also that HTTP is probably not the best choice in
such a situation, and XML is a deadly enemy. CSV formatted data over
socket would be much more efficient.

If you really need to move a massive amount of data around, and
you are crazy enough to do it using phpxmlrpc, your best bet is to
bypass usage of the xmlrpcval objects, at least in the decoding phase,
and have the server (or client) object return to the calling function
directly php values (see xmlrpc_client::return_type
and xmlrpc_server::functions_parameters_type for more
details).

=== My server (client) returns an error whenever the client (server) returns accented characters

To be documented...

=== How to enable long-lasting method calls::

To be documented...

=== My client returns "XML-RPC Fault #2: Invalid return payload: enable debugging to examine incoming payload": what should I do?

The response you are seeing is a default error response that the
client object returns to the php application when the server did not
respond to the call with a valid xmlrpc response.

The most likely cause is that you are not using the correct URL
when creating the client object, or you do not have appropriate access
rights to the web page you are requesting, or some other common http
misconfiguration.

To find out what the server is really returning to your client,
you have to enable the debug mode of the client, using
`+$client->setDebug(1)+`;

=== How can I save to a file the xml of the xmlrpc responses received from servers?

If what you need is to save the responses received from the server
as xml, you have two options:

1- use the serialize() method on the response object.

[source, php]
----
$resp = $client->send($msg);
if (!$resp->faultCode())
  $data_to_be_saved = $resp->serialize();
----

Note that this will not be 100% accurate, since the xml generated
by the response object can be different from the xml received,
especially if there is some character set conversion involved, or such
(eg. if you receive an empty string tag as <string/>, serialize()
will output <string></string>), or if the server sent back
as response something invalid (in which case the xml generated client
side using serialize() will correspond to the error response generated
internally by the lib).

2 - set the client object to return the raw xml received instead
  of the decoded objects:

[source, php]
----
$client = new xmlrpc_client($url);
$client->return_type = 'xml';
$resp = $client->send($msg);
if (!$resp->faultCode())
  $data_to_be_saved = $resp->value();
----

Note that using this method the xml response will not be
parsed at all by the library, only the http communication protocol will
be checked. This means that xmlrpc responses sent by the server that
would have generated an error response on the client (eg. malformed xml,
responses that have faultcode set, etc...) now will not be flagged as
invalid, and you might end up saving not valid xml but random
junk...

=== Can I use the ms windows character set?::

If the data your application is using comes from a Microsoft
application, there are some chances that the character set used to
encode it is CP1252 (the same might apply to data received from an
external xmlrpc server/client, but it is quite rare to find xmlrpc
toolkits that encode to CP1252 instead of UTF8). It is a character set
which is "almost" compatible with ISO 8859-1, but for a few extra
characters.

PHP-XMLRPC only supports the ISO 8859-1 and UTF8 character sets.
The net result of this situation is that those extra characters will not
be properly encoded, and will be received at the other end of the
XML-RPC transmission as "garbled data". Unfortunately the library cannot
provide real support for CP1252 because of limitations in the PHP 4 xml
parser. Luckily, we tried our best to support this character set anyway,
and, since version 2.2.1, there is some form of support, left commented
in the code.

To properly encode outgoing data that is natively in CP1252, you
will have to uncomment all relative code in the file
__xmlrpc.inc__ (you can search for the string "1252"),
then set `+GLOBALS['xmlrpc_internalencoding']='CP1252';+`
Please note that all incoming data will then be fed to your application
as UTF-8 to avoid any potential data loss.

=== Does the library support using cookies / http sessions?::

In short: yes, but a little coding is needed to make it happen.

The code below uses sessions to e.g. let the client store a value
on the server and retrieve it later.

[source, php]
----
$resp = $client->send(new xmlrpcmsg('registervalue', array(new xmlrpcval('foo'), new xmlrpcval('bar'))));
if (!$resp->faultCode())
{
  $cookies = $resp->cookies();
  if (array_key_exists('PHPSESSID', $cookies)) // nb: make sure to use the correct session cookie name
  {
    $session_id = $cookies['PHPSESSID']['value'];

    // do some other stuff here...

    $client->setcookie('PHPSESSID', $session_id);
    $val = $client->send(new xmlrpcmsg('getvalue', array(new xmlrpcval('foo')));
  }
}
----

Server-side sessions are handled normally like in any other
php application. Please see the php manual for more information about
sessions.

NB: unlike web browsers, not all xmlrpc clients support usage of
http cookies. If you have troubles with sessions and control only the
server side of the communication, please check with the makers of the
xmlrpc client in use.

=== Integration with the PHP xmlrpc extension

To be documented more...

In short: for the fastest execution possible, you can enable the php
native xmlrpc extension, and use it in conjunction with phpxmlrpc. The
following code snippet gives an example of such integration

[source, php]
----
/*** client side ***/
$c = new xmlrpc_client('http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/server.php');

// tell the client to return raw xml as response value
$c->return_type = 'xml';

// let the native xmlrpc extension take care of encoding request parameters
$r = $c->send(xmlrpc_encode_request('examples.getStateName', $_POST['stateno']));

if ($r->faultCode())
  // HTTP transport error
  echo 'Got error '.$r->faultCode();
else
{
  // HTTP request OK, but XML returned from server not parsed yet
  $v = xmlrpc_decode($r->value());
  // check if we got a valid xmlrpc response from server
  if ($v === NULL)
    echo 'Got invalid response';
  else
  // check if server sent a fault response
  if (xmlrpc_is_fault($v))
    echo 'Got xmlrpc fault '.$v['faultCode'];
  else
    echo'Got response: '.htmlentities($v);
}
----

=== Substitution of the PHP xmlrpc extension

Yet another interesting situation is when you are using a ready-made
php application, that provides support for the XMLRPC protocol via the
native php xmlrpc extension, but the extension is not available on your
php install (e.g. because of shared hosting constraints).

Since version 2.1, the PHP-XMLRPC library provides a compatibility
layer that aims to be 100% compliant with the xmlrpc extension API. This
means that any code written to run on the extension should obtain the
exact same results, albeit using more resources and a longer processing
time, using the PHP-XMLRPC library and the extension compatibility module.
The module is part of the EXTRAS package, available as a separate download
from the sourceforge.net website, since version 0.2


[[debugger]]
== Usage of the debugger

A webservice debugger is included in the library to help during development and testing.

The interface should be self-explicative enough to need little documentation.

image::debugger.gif[,,,,align="center"]

The most useful feature of the debugger is without doubt the "Show debug info" option. It allows to have a screen dump
of the complete http communication between client and server, including the http headers as well as the request and
response payloads, and is invaluable when troubleshooting problems with charset encoding, authentication or http
compression.

The debugger can take advantage of the JSONRPC library extension, to allow debugging of JSON-RPC webservices, and of the
JSXMLRPC library visual editor to allow easy mouse-driven construction of the payload for remote methods. Both
components have to be downloaded separately and copied to the debugger directory to enable the extra functionality:

* to enable jsonrpc functionality, download the PHP-XMLRPC EXTRAS package, and copy the file __jsonrpc.inc__
  either to the same directory as the debugger or somewhere in your php include path

* to enable the visual value editing dialog, download the JS-XMLRPC library, and copy somewhere in the web root files
  __visualeditor.php__, __visualeditor.css__ and the folders __yui__ and __img__. Then edit the debugger file __controller.php__
  and set appropriately the variable `+$editorpath+`.


== Upgrading

If you are upgrading from version 3 or earlier you have two options:

1. adapt your code to the new API (all changes needed are described in [doc/api_changes_v4.md](doc/api_changes_v4.md))

2. use instead the *compatibility layer* which is provided. Instructions and pitfalls described in [doc/api_changes_v4.md](doc/api_changes_v4.md##enabling-compatibility-with-legacy-code)

In any case, read carefully the docs available online at https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/blob/master/doc/api_changes_v4.md
and report back any undocumented issue using GitHub.

== Running tests

The recommended way to run the library's test suite is via the provided Docker containers.
A handy shell script is available that simplifies usage of Docker.

The full sequence of operations is:

    ./tests/ci/vm.sh build
    ./tests/ci/vm.sh start
    ./tests/ci/vm.sh runtests
    ./tests/ci/vm.sh stop

    # and, once you have finished all testing related work:
    ./tests/ci/vm.sh cleanup

By default, tests are run using php 7.4 in a Container based on Ubuntu 20 Focal.
You can change the version of PHP and Ubuntu in use by setting the environment variables PHP_VERSION and UBUNTU_VERSION
before building the Container.

To generate the code-coverage report, run `./tests/ci/vm.sh runcoverage`

Note: to reduce the size of the download, the test suite is not part of the default package installed with Composer.
In order to have it onboard, install the library using Composer option `--prefer-install=source`.
